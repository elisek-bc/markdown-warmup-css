<h2>The Website</h2>

<p>We have found <a href="https://www.gratiz.nl/.>GratiZ.nl" target="_blank">GratiZ.nl</a><br>

This is a Dutch website with promotions and info on free items.</p>


<h2>Updates</h2>

<p>The most recent update was <b>Friday 22-2-2019 at 10AM</b>.<br>

This is mentioned on the website underneath the menu bar.</p>


<h2>Search</h2>

<p>Claudia found the website by googling 'Slechte websites'.<br>

We opened <a href="https://www.victorweblog.nl/20-slechtste-websites/" target="_blank">Victor Weblog</a>.<br>

This website shows a top 20 of bad websites.<br>

<b>Gratiz.nl</b> was number 18 on the list.</p>


<h2>Why does this website need an update?</h2>

<p>The website looks outdated. Poor choice of colors and color combinations. The  title image is unclear and badly placed. There's too much text on every page which makes it hard to read. The ad takesup a lot of space on the top of the page which draws too much attention.</p>


<h2>Social Media</h2>

<p><b>GratiZ.nl</b> has a Facebook page. This is mentioned on their homepage, with a link. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GratiZ.nl/" target="_blank"">Click here to visit on Facebook.</a></p>


<h2>Top priorities</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>Colors</b><br>

   <p><i>Tone down the colors to make it more pleasing for the eye.<br>

   The entire color palette needs to change in order to make it more modern.</i></li></p>

<li><b>Text Layout</b><br>

   <p><i>More whitespace between the different offers.<br>

   Styling the fonts for a better overview.</i></li></p>


<li><b>Homepage</b><br>

   <p><i>Create a new homepage, because the current one contains a list of the category of free items <br>

   A short and clean explanation of the website, combined with a shortlist of the most popular promo's would make a better homepage.</i></li></p>
</ol>
